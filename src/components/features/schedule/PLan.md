## Technical Details

### Data Structure

The implementation uses the Schedule interface from api.types.ts with the following key fields:

- group_id and group_name for event identification
- start_time and end_time for scheduling
- teacher for instructor information
- room for location details
- meeting_link for online sessions

### Component Architecture

- TimeTable.tsx: Main container and state management
- TimeTableDailyView.tsx: Daily schedule visualization
- TimeTableWeeklyView.tsx: Weekly calendar grid
- TimeTableEventCard.tsx: Event display component
- TimeTableEventModal.tsx: Event creation/editing form
- TimeTableFilters.tsx: Filtering sidebar with room integration

### State Management

- Redux store with time-table.slice.ts and room.slice.ts
- Custom useTimeTable hook for schedule operations
- useRoom hook for room management
- Integration with existing group and teacher data

### Known Issues

- Type issues with react-hook-form and zod integration in TimeTableEventModal
- Form library integration requires additional type refinement

## Testing and Quality Assurance

‚úÖ Completed:

- Event creation validation
- Display in different views
- Basic filtering functionality
- Date navigation
- Component integration
- Room management integration
- Type safety for filters

üîÑ Ongoing:

- Edge case handling
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Form type issues resolution

## Dependencies

- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Shared UI component library
- Zod for form validation
- Date-fns for date manipulation
- React Hook Form for form handling

### üõ†Ô∏è Recent Fixes

- **Form Type Consistency:**
  - Made `delivery_mode` a required field in the Zod schema for the event modal form (was previously optional or defaulted).
  - This resolves a type mismatch between the Zod schema and the form type (`FormValues`), ensuring type safety and compatibility between the form and validation schema.
  - The form now always expects and validates a value for `delivery_mode`.
