# PRD: AI feature role authentication system fixes

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: AI feature role authentication system fixes
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

The AI assistant feature in the Chemist application currently has critical authentication and role management issues that prevent it from properly recognizing logged-in users and their roles. Users report that even when authenticated, the AI system treats them as public/unauthenticated users, limiting their access to personalized data and role-specific functionalities.

This document identifies the root causes of these authentication issues and provides a comprehensive plan to fix the role-based access control system for the AI feature, ensuring authenticated users receive appropriate AI responses based on their roles and permissions.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals

- Ensure AI assistant properly recognizes authenticated users and their roles
- Provide role-specific AI responses and data access
- Maintain security boundaries between different user roles
- Improve user experience by personalizing AI interactions based on user context
- Ensure compliance with data access permissions

### 2.2 User goals

- Receive personalized AI responses based on their authenticated role
- Access role-appropriate data and functionality through AI interactions
- Get accurate user context in AI conversations
- Experience seamless authentication flow with the AI system

### 2.3 Non-goals

- Redesigning the entire authentication system
- Changing the core AI response algorithms
- Modifying existing role definitions or permissions
- Overhauling the user interface design

## 3. User personas

### 3.1 Key user types

- Teachers accessing student and class information
- Administrators managing system-wide data
- Staff members with specific role permissions
- Students with limited access to their own data

### 3.2 Basic persona details

- **Teachers**: Need access to their assigned classes, student information, and teaching schedules
- **Administrators**: Require full system access including financial data, user management, and reports
- **Staff**: Access specific modules based on their role (reception, finance, etc.)
- **Students**: Limited access to personal information like schedules and grades

### 3.3 Role-based access

- **Teachers**: Can access student data for their classes, view schedules, and manage attendance
- **Administrators**: Full access to all system functionality and data
- **Staff**: Module-specific access based on role assignment
- **Students**: Read-only access to personal data only

## 4. Functional requirements

### 4.1 Authentication token management

**Token transmission in streaming requests** (Priority: Critical)
- EventSource streaming requests must include authentication headers
- Implement custom EventSource with authorization support
- Ensure token validation on server-side for streaming endpoints

**Token refresh handling** (Priority: High)
- Implement automatic token refresh for long-running AI conversations
- Handle token expiration gracefully during streaming
- Maintain conversation context during token refresh

### 4.2 User context propagation

**User account initialization** (Priority: Critical)
- Ensure user account data is fetched and set in Redux store after login
- Validate account data presence before AI interactions
- Handle account loading states properly

**Role-based context passing** (Priority: High)
- Pass user role and permissions to AI service requests
- Include user context in conversation initialization
- Ensure role information is available for AI response customization

### 4.3 Server-side authentication

**Streaming endpoint authentication** (Priority: Critical)
- Implement JWT validation for `/ai/chat/stream` endpoint
- Extract user context from authenticated requests
- Provide user role information to AI processing pipeline

**Session management** (Priority: High)
- Maintain user session state across streaming connections
- Implement proper session timeout handling
- Ensure consistent user context throughout conversations

## 5. User experience

### 5.1 Entry points & first-time user flow

### 5.2 Core experience

- **Authenticated AI interaction**: Users interact with AI system that recognizes their identity and role
  - AI responses include role-appropriate data and suggestions
  - User context is maintained throughout the conversation
  - Access permissions are respected in all AI operations

- **Role-specific responses**: AI provides different levels of information based on user role
  - Teachers receive student-specific data for their classes
  - Administrators get comprehensive system insights
  - Students receive limited personal information

### 5.3 Advanced features & edge cases

- **Token expiration handling**: Seamless token refresh during active AI conversations
- **Role change detection**: AI system updates user context when roles are modified
- **Session persistence**: Conversation context maintained across browser sessions
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation to public mode if authentication fails

### 5.4 UI/UX highlights

- **Role indicator**: Clear display of current user role in AI interface
- **Permission feedback**: Informative messages when access is restricted
- **Authentication status**: Visual indication of login status and AI capabilities
- **Personalized greetings**: Role-specific welcome messages and interaction hints

## 6. Narrative

Sarah is a teacher who logs into the Chemist system to check her student's progress. She navigates to the AI assistant expecting to get insights about her classes, but instead receives generic responses as if she were an anonymous user. The AI doesn't recognize her role or provide access to her student data. After implementing the fixes described in this document, Sarah will experience a fully personalized AI interaction where the system recognizes her as a teacher, greets her by name, and provides specific information about her assigned classes and students, making her workflow much more efficient and the AI truly useful for her daily tasks.
